Ardis Icon Theme is a project originally created by Kotus Works <kotus.works@gmail.com>

This project's goal is to create a truly open source icon theme, to support every DE, and to theme as many applications as possible.

Ardis Icon Theme's inspiration is drawn from a combination of styles including

        - Numix utouchicon theme: https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-utouch
        - Simple icon theme: http://kxmylo.deviantart.com/art/Simple-icon-theme-426040287
        - Flamini icon pack: http://kotusworks.deviantart.com/art/Flamini-icons-set-for-KDE-437738820
        
Every icon in this icon pack is in .svg format with size of 512x512 px.
